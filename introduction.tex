Before we get into technical details I want to first sketch why a typed
language for smart contracts might be important.
Since the dawn of the internet there has been a growing need for fast and
secure transfer of money.
Cash transfers are simply out of the question nowadays with applications like
personal banking from the comfort of your home, online stores that have a wider
assortment than would be possible and practical in a single physical location
(Amazon, Alibaba), crowdfunding which enables creators to produce new and
interesting items with low risk since the investors are also the customers and
a great many more wonderful things.
All of these would not be possible without fast and secure digital payments.
